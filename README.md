## 📝 Introduction
**Agentar-Scale-SQL** is a novel framework that leverages scalable computation to significantly improve Text-to-SQL performance on challenging benchmarks. By implementing an Orchestrated Test-Time Scaling strategy, our framework synergistically combines three distinct perspectives to bridge the gap between state-of-the-art models and human expert performance.

## 🎉 News
